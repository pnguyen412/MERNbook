# MERN Book Search Engine

## Description
- The main objective of this challenge was to take starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.
- In addition to the above, we used the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.
- I learned how to set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.
- I also learned how to modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.

## Installation & Usage:
- Clone the repository on github locally.
